      <p class="intro">
        My name is Dan Zhu. I like traveling, cooking, and baking. I spend most
        of my time working and spending time with my family. I didn’t finish my
        bachelor’s degree before I came to the United States, and I always
        wanted to get one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started taking classes in community college and getting my associate
        degree.
        <span class="sentence"
          >Then I became a full-time mom. All the time I spent at home with my
          kid made me anxious, and I wondered what I could do to make a
          difference.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I found a fantastic code camp in my local area called Launch Code.
        It provides code training in JavaScript and Java and a little bit of
        database training. After I finished the training course, I joined their
        apprenticeship program, which provided job opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the apprenticeship training, I built the app with teams together.
        After that, I luckily got a full-time job as a front-end developer.
