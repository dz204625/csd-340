      <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        My name is Dan Zhu. I like <span id="traveling">_________</span>,
        cooking, and baking. I spend most of my time working and spending time
        with my family. I didn’t finish my bachelor’s degree before I came to
        the <span id="united_states">_________</span>, and I always wanted to
        get one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started taking classes in
        <span id="community_college">_________</span> and getting my associate
        degree.
        <span class="sentence"
          >Then I became a full-time mom. All the time I spent at home with my
          kid made me anxious, and I wondered what I could do to make a
          difference.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I found a fantastic code camp in my local area called
        <span id="launch_code">_________</span>. It provides code training in
        JavaScript and Java and a little bit of database training. After I
        finished the training course, I joined their apprenticeship program,
        which provided job opportunities. In the apprenticeship training, I
        built the app with teams together. After that, I luckily got a full-time
        job as a front-end developer.
